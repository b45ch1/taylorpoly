       abstract = "For any typical multivariable expression $f$, point $a$ in the domain of $f$, and
         positive integer maxorder, this method produces the numerical values of all partial derivatives at
         $a$ up through order maxorder. By the technique known as automatic differentiation, theoretically
         exact results are obtained using numerical (as opposed to symbolic) manipulation. The key ideas are
         a hyperpyramid data structure and a generalized Leibniz's rule. Any expression in $n$ variables
         corresponds to a hyperpyramid array, in $n$-dimensional space, containing the numerical values of
         all unique partial derivatives (not wasting space on different permutations of derivatives). The
         arrays for simple expressions are combined by hyperpyramid operators to form the arrays for more
         complicated expressions. These operators are facilitated by a generalized Leibniz's rule which,
         given a product of multivariable functions, produces any partial derivative by forming the minimum
         number of products (between two lower partials) together with a product of binomial coefficients.
         The algorithms are described in abstract pseudo-code. A section on implementation shows how these
         ideas can be converted into practical and efficient programs in a typical computing environment. For
         any specific problem, only the expression itself would require recoding.",

                   growing area of theoretical research and software
                   development concerned with the accurate and efficient
                   evaluation of derivatives for function evaluations
                   given as computer programs. The resulting derivative
                   values are useful for all scientific computations that
                   are based on linear, quadratic, or higher order
                   approximations to nonlinear scalar or vector
                   functions.\par AD has been applied in particular to
                   optimization, parameter identification, nonlinear
                   equation solving, the numerical integration of
                   differential equations, and combinations of these.
                   Apart from quantifying sensitivities numerically, AD
                   also yields structural dependence information, such as
                   the sparsity pattern and generic rank of Jacobian
                   matrices. The field opens up an exciting opportunity to
                   develop new algorithms that reflect the true cost of
                   accurate derivatives and to use them for improvements
                   in speed and reliability.\par This second edition has
                   been updated and expanded to cover recent developments
                   in applications and theory, including an elegant NP
                   completeness argument by Uwe Naumann and a brief
                   introduction to scarcity, a generalization of sparsity.
                   There is also added material on checkpointing and
                   iterative differentiation. To improve readability the
                   more detailed analysis of memory and complexity bounds
                   has been relegated to separate, optional chapters.The
                   book consists of three parts: a stand-alone
                   introduction to the fundamentals of AD and its
                   software; a thorough treatment of methods for sparse
                   problems; and final chapters on program-reversal
                   schedules, higher derivatives, nonsmooth problems and
                   iterative processes. Each of the 15 chapters concludes
                   with examples and exercises.",

                   manifolds and normal forms of vector fields, and
                   estimate the computational cost when applied to simple
                   models. By simple we mean that the model can be written
                   using a finite sequence of compositions of arithmetic
                   operations and elementary functions. In this case, the
                   tools of Automatic Differentiation are the key to
                   produce efficient algorithms. By efficient we mean that
                   the cost of computing the coefficients up to order k of
                   the expansion of a d-dimensional invariant manifold

         modern methods of computational differentiation can be recognized as an example for the application
         of conventional ``approximate'' numerical techniques on a non-archimedean extension of the
         real numbers. In many cases, the application of ``infinitely small'' numbers instead of
         ''small but finite'' numbers allows the use of the old numerical algorithm, but
         now with an error that in a rigorous way can be shown to become infinitely small (and hence
         irrelevant). While intuitive ideas in this direction have accompanied analysis from the early days
         of Newton and Leibniz, the first rigorous work goes back to Levi-Civita, who introduced a number
         field that in the past few years turned out to be particularly suitable for numerical problems.
         While Levi-Civita's field appears to be of fundamental importance and simplicity, efforts to
         introduce advanced concepts of calculus on it are only very new. In this paper, we address several
         of the basic questions providing a foundation for such a calculus. After addressing questions of
         algebra and convergence, we study questions of differentiability, in particular with an eye to
         usefulness for practical work.",
